# Ecosystem & Business Model

## Value Proposition

**"See what Inflow doesn't show you."**

We're not replacing Inflow—we're extending it for power users who need:
- Custom reporting beyond built-in views
- Data quality monitoring and cleanup
- Programmatic access for automation
- Integration with other systems

## Target Users

### Primary: Inflow Power Users
- Hit the ceiling on built-in reports
- Managing 1000+ SKUs
- Need reorder automation
- Want data exports for analysis

### Secondary: Developers/Consultants
- Building integrations for clients
- Need typed API access
- Want to automate inventory workflows

## Go-to-Market

### Phase 1: Open Source Credibility
- Publish all packages as MIT-licensed
- Documentation-first approach
- GitHub presence establishes trust

### Phase 2: Self-Service Tool
- User provides token + companyID
- Runs locally (user controls their data)
- Instant dashboard with insights
- Zero trust required—it's their machine

### Phase 3: Hosted Service (Optional)
- For users who don't want to run locally
- OAuth integration (if Inflow supports)
- Subscription model for ongoing sync + dashboard

### Phase 4: Lead Capture → Services
- Chatbot on dashboard: "Need custom integrations?"
- Qualified leads already trust the tool
- Upsell: custom development, consulting, managed service

## Trust Ladder

```
Awareness    → Find us via search, Inflow forums, word of mouth
Interest     → Read docs, see architecture, understand value
Evaluation   → Run locally with their own data (zero trust needed)
Trial        → Use dashboard, see insights
Adoption     → Regular usage, depends on the tool
Advocacy     → Recommends to other Inflow users
Expansion    → Wants custom work → revenue
```
