### Post 1: The "Genuine Question" (r/smallbusiness, r/Entrepreneur)

**Title:** Those of you using inventory software—how do you catch data quality issues before they become expensive?

**Body:**
```
Running a small manufacturing operation and I've noticed our inventory data gets messy over time. Duplicate entries, costs that don't match reality, stuff that expired months ago still showing as "in stock."

Curious how others handle this:
- Do you do regular audits?
- Any automated tools that catch this stuff?
- Or just deal with it when it becomes a problem?

We're on Inflow but I imagine this happens with any system.
```

**Why it works:** Genuine question, invites discussion, positions you as someone who understands the problem.

### Post 2: The "Value Share" (r/smallbusiness, r/manufacturing)

**Title:** 6 inventory data problems that cost small manufacturers money (and how to spot them)

**Body:**
```
I've worked with a lot of small manufacturers on their inventory data. These are the problems I see over and over:

**1. Duplicate SKUs**
Same item entered 3 different ways. "Vitamin E Oil", "Vit E Oil", "VIT-E-OIL-1oz". Your reports are now useless.

**2. Cost drift**
Your BOM says it costs $4.50 to make. Actual ingredient costs crept up to $5.80. Margin gone.

**3. Phantom inventory**
System says 500 units. Warehouse has 312. Nobody knows why.

**4. Expired ingredients**
Ingredients have lot numbers and expiration dates. Your inventory system doesn't track them. FDA comes knocking.

**5. Vendor concentration**
80% of your ingredients come from 2 suppliers. One has a shortage, you're dead.

**6. Orphaned records**
Products linked to vendors that don't exist anymore. Purchase orders that reference deleted items.

Most of these hide in plain sight. The data is there—nobody's looking at it the right way.

If you're on Inflow, I built some open source tools that surface these automatically. Happy to share if anyone's interested.
```

**Why it works:** Genuine value. Specific. Shows expertise. Soft CTA at end.

### Post 3: The "Story" (r/Entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness)

**Title:** I found $47K in expired inventory hiding in a client's data

**Body:**
```
Helped a cosmetics manufacturer audit their Inflow data last month. They thought everything was fine.

Ran some queries against their database. Found:
- 23 ingredients past expiration date
- Total value: $47,000
- Some expired 8+ months ago

The data was all there. Inflow captured the lot numbers and dates. But their reports didn't surface it, and nobody was looking.

They had to write it all off. Could've been caught months earlier with a simple automated check.

Now I'm building tools to catch this stuff automatically. Anyone else dealt with inventory blind spots like this?
```

**Why it works:** Concrete story, specific numbers, establishes credibility.

### When someone asks about inventory software:

```
What kind of products are you tracking? For manufacturing (especially cosmetics/food), you'll want something that handles:
- Lot tracking
- Expiration dates
- BOM costing
- Multi-location

Inflow handles most of this. The bigger challenge is keeping the data clean over time—duplicates creep in, costs get stale, etc.
```

### When someone complains about messy data:

```
This is super common. The data entry is usually fine at first, then entropy takes over.

A few things that help:
1. Naming conventions (documented, enforced)
2. Regular duplicate scans
3. Automated alerts for anomalies

I've been building some open source tools for this if you're on Inflow. DM me if you want to take a look.
```

### When someone asks about cosmetics manufacturing:

```
Are you tracking lot numbers and expiration dates? This is huge for cosmetics—FDA requires traceability.

Most inventory systems capture this data but don't surface it well. You need reports that show "ingredients expiring in 30 days" or "which finished goods used lot #X."
```
